My Infrastructure-as-Code ⚙️Ansible/❄️Nix code for HomeLab & VPS

Content Warning: I'm migrating ALL MY VPS INSTANCES from Ansible to Nix, since all of them are running non-critical tasks. The new experimental DN42 project is also using Nix. Most of the Nix code is AI-generated (vibe-coded) crap, but it works anyway. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

My HomeLab setup is still using Ansible and developed by me manually.

## HomeLab

See [README.md](https://github.com/lyc8503/infra/tree/master/homelab)

## Nix

WIP
